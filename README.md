If you want to play the latest official version of the game, you can find the finals products in [Finals](http://github.com/Sergio-P/Kart/tree/master/Finals) directory, you may download directly the [jar file](http://github.com/Sergio-P/Kart/blob/master/Finals/KartGame.jar?raw=true) or the [apk](http://github.com/Sergio-P/Kart/blob/master/Finals/KartGame.apk?raw=true)


## Importing
If you want to import the source code of the project to change some feauteres or add other ones. Yo have to follow this steps:

1. Create a new LibGDX game. Follow the instructions in the [official page](http://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-Setup-Gradle). Now you will have the project schema of a LibGDX game.
2. In [Project](http://github.com/Sergio-P/Kart/tree/master/Project) there are 2 subdirectories. Copy the content of `assets` to your assets folder.
3. Copy the content of `src` to `core/src`. Be carefully about the packages names, use refractoring tools to solve these issues.

Now you have the Kart project imported in your local machine!
